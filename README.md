# Unleashed Project

# Code

This is the code for the Unleashed website. Unleashed is a web application that allows users to search for pubs in a specific location and view them on a map. Users can also interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model.

## How to Use

To use the Unleashed website, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Enter a location in the search input field and click the "Search" button. This will display a list of pubs in the specified location.

3. The list of pubs will be shown on the left side of the page, and a map will be displayed on the right side. The map will be centered around the specified location, and markers will indicate the positions of the pubs.

4. Click on a pub name in the list to view more information about the pub.

5. Interact with the chatbot by entering questions in the chat input field and pressing Enter. The chatbot will respond with answers generated by the GPT-3.5 language model.

## Dependencies

The Unleashed website has the following dependencies:

- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview): The website uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to display the map and place markers on it.

- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create): The chatbot functionality is powered by the OpenAI API. You will need an API key to make requests to the API.

## File Structure

The code is organized into the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the website.

- `assets/css/reset.css`: A CSS file that resets the default styles of HTML elements.

- `assets/css/style.css`: A CSS file that contains custom styles for the website.

- `assets/scripts/keys.js`: A JavaScript file that contains the API keys needed for the website to function properly.

- `assets/scripts/chatGPT.js`: A JavaScript file that handles interactions with the OpenAI chatbot API.

- `assets/scripts/script.js`: A JavaScript file that contains the main logic of the website, including event handlers and map functionality.

- `assets/scripts/map.js`: A JavaScript file that initializes the Google Maps API and handles map-related functionality.

## Custom Styles

The website has custom styles defined in the `style.css` file. These styles define the appearance and layout of various elements on the page. Some of the key style definitions include:

- `h1`, `h2`: Custom font styles for heading elements.

- `body`: Sets the background color of the page.

- `aside`: Styles for the side section of the page that contains the pub list.

- `ul`, `li`: Styles for the pub list.

- `.hide`: Defines a class that can be used to hide elements by setting their `display` property to `none`.

- `@media` query: Defines custom styles for screens with a maximum width of 600px, optimizing the layout for smaller screens.

## Note

Please make sure to provide the necessary API keys in the `keys.js` file for the website to function correctly. You will need a Google Maps API key and an OpenAI API key.

Enjoy using Unleashed to find and explore pubs in your area!
